   [cowsay](https://web.archive.org/web/20071026043648/http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml),
   and [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) for better integration
1. Install `aonemd/dazzle.vim` using a plugin manger such as:

2. Call `Dazzle` command for your presentation files only:
3. Open your presentations: `vim *.pres`
4. Zoom-in on your terminal and dazzle everyone!

  " use dazzle for .pres files
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.pres :Dazzle
  ```

### Features and Maps

- Scroll between slides using `Left` and `Right` arrow keys
- Text between two backticks `` ` `` is treated as special text and thus, is colored üçé
- Text between two asterisks `*` is treated as important text and thus, is **bold**
- `[ ]` and `[x]` are converted to ASCII characters
- Lines starting with `*` or `-` are converted to ASCII bullet points
- `Q` executes the current line as a shell command and prints the output into Vim
- `<leader>t` converts current line into ASCII title using `figlet`
- `<leader>b` converts current line into ASCII banner using `toilet`
- `<leader>c` converts current line into ASCII cow quote using `cowsay`

### Credits

I made this plugin after watching those two YouTube videos:
  - [Creating technical presentations with VIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDa7hrbcCB8)
  - [Giving a Text Based Slide Presentation in Vim without Plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fIR55kkTwc)

So all thanks to their creators for their content.
